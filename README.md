## Introduction

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms, making it easier for researchers, students, and practitioners to explore and implement various techniques in their projects.

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes implementations of the following machine-learning algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Naive Bayes
8. Neural Networks
9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
10. K-Means Clustering

Each algorithm is organized in its own directory and includes the necessary code files, as well as any additional resources or datasets that may be required to run the algorithm.
